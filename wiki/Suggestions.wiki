#summary Suggestions for Powershell 2 Splunk

Feel free to add comments on what you'd like to get from this integration. 
Should it be a Powershell Provider representing Splunk's configuration and searches in a virtual drive view, or may be a Snap-In with a number of cmdlets?
Or perhaps, you are already satisfied with what existing Splunk CLI provides and don't see any advantage of using Powershell?
